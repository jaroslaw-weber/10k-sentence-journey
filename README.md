# 10k Sentence Journey

Welcome to the 10k SentenceJourney! This tool is designed to help users learn Korean by reading through sentences in a structured manner. It uses a frequency-based approach to help learners progressively understand and memorize words in context.

## How It Works

The application presents users with Korean sentences featuring a range of vocabulary. These sentences are selected based on frequency to ensure learners encounter common words more often, aiding in quicker and more effective language acquisition.

### Key Features

- **Progressive Learning:** Begin with simpler and more frequent words, gradually introducing more complex vocabulary.
- **Tracking Progress:** Users can mark words they have learned, which hides them from future sentences to focus on unlearned vocabulary.
- **Randomized Sentence Presentation:** Offers a varied learning experience with each use to enhance retention and engagement.

## Frequency List

The vocabulary used in the sentences is derived from the following frequency list:
[Wiktionary Korean 5800](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Korean_5800)
